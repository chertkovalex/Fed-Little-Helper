Background
===

While working on a feature for [GhostStory](https://github.com/thingsinjars/GhostStory), I found myself trying to figure out how Chrome DevTools Extensions worked. Seeing as it took the best part of a day to actually get the basics in place (even using the [docs](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devtools.html) and [samples](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples.html)), I figure it might help to have a working example.
